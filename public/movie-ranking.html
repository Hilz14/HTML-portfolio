<p></p><h3>1. Shawshank Redemption</h3> </p>
<p>Shawshank redemption is a brilliant,
 severely underestimated cinematic work of art
  by the one and only Frank Darabont. 
  this movie explores many complex themes 
  and overall is a movie showcasing the power 
  of strength and resilience by an ordinary
   individual.</p>

   <p> <h3> 2. The Truman show </h3></p>
   Jim Carey. Just when you think you know an Actor,they show you a whole new dimension. I am astounded at the lack of awards 
   received by Carey himself for the portrayal of Truman, a man who had the rights to his slife sold by his parents to a television corporation and in turn had his whole life broadcasted to the whole world. Without his knowledge of course. And only till he found out. 
   I promise, that is not a spoiler in the least. Bravo sir, they just don't make movies like that any more.

    <p> <h3> 3. Shutter Island</h3></p>
    At which point are we going to retrospectively give Leonardo DiCaprio the awards he deserves for his tremendous acting skills. This film messed with my mind so bad, and trust me I thought inception was bad. 
   <br> Run, don't walk to watch this. You will not regret it .<br>
